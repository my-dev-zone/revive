However, since laws vary from region to region, it is impossible for Source Revive to warrant that this process will comply with the local marketing and legal regulations where you reside - specifically in terms of what you are promoting, and the content used to create your site and your promotions. (For example, most countries tightly govern any marketing material connected with financial services, investments, and so on). Therefore it is entirely your responsibility to conduct due diligence to ensure that the sites you are creating comply with all applicable laws in your country, province or state.</p>

<p>Source Revive hereby disclaims all representations, claims and warranties regarding the legality of using the service or some/all of its features with respect to internet laws & marketing regulations where you reside.</p>

You further agree to fully cooperate and, if necessary, provide assistance with all internal monitoring and investigations of our client base and the operations of our website.</p>

<p>7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES.</p>
<p>Several of the supplied functions of Source Revive use third-party data (or a custom variation thereof) and/or rely on third-party services, where Source Revive has no control over the ongoing performance, accuracy or usability of these features or services. (For example, our keyword-tracking reports available in the Reporting area of the dashboard.)</p>

<p>6. ENDING THE SERVICE:</p>

<p>6.1 TERMINATION. Source Revive may cancel any member account at any time and restrict access (upon canceling the payment contract as well), without notice or stated reason. Obviously, this will generally only occur in cases of member abuse in accordance with our restrictions policy, but we do still reserve the right to terminate any user account without notice, for any reason we deem suitable. In the case of abuse or violations of this user agreement, any remaining credit balance will also be forfeited.</p>

<p>6.2 CANCELLATION. Members can cancel their account at any time by contacting Source Revive via the support desk and requesting cancellation. This will result in the user being locked out of the account when their current 30 day membership</p>


<p>REFUNDS AND GUARANTEES ARE AS FOLLOWS</p>


<p>7.3 REFUNDS. Minute purchases are bought with the understanding that they are a non refundable purchase after the user has spent their first minutes in the system after the purchase of minutes. Purchases are also un-refundable after 30 days regardless of minutes used.</p>

<p>For example, if a user buys minutes for an account and does not use them they are entitled to a refund if desired in the first 30 days. After the user creates a crawl and begins use of the minutes they are non refundable. This applies to sub sequent purchases. It is up to the user to request cancellation via our support desk or cancel their subscription via their credit card or cancellation button inside the membership.</p>

<p>In the case of unauthorized or fraudulent access to your PayPal account or credit card, given adequate proof or evidence, as deemed adequate solely by Source Revive and where our staff has not yet started to work on it. You may also need to contact your payment account / credit card company as well, to ensure that your account is secure. Please note that we reserve the right to submit your claim to the relevant authorities if we are suspicious about the validity of your claim.</p>

<p>* Other similar scenarios, on a case by case (discretionary) basis and within reason. Our goal is to earn your long-term business, and we realize that sometimes, things go awry. So in legitimate cases and where we deem reasonable, existing credit balance refunds can be processed on request, and at the sole discretion of Source Revive.</p>

<p>Refunds WILL NOT BE PROCESSED ON A RESULTS BASIS. Source Revive does not guarantee results or desired outcomes after purchase. It is up to the user to use the software to find the desired results and no refunds will be processed on the basis of results</p>

<p>Refunds WILL NOT BE PROCESSED ON TECHNICAL ERRORS. The software and the systems it runs of exist largely out of Source Revives control. In case of errors or issues we will do our best to resolve these errors in a timely fashion. Our goal is your long term business, and in legitimate cases we may process refunds due to grave errors. This is left sole to Source Revive’s digression</p>


<p>No refunds of any kind will be considered for any customer if the most recent credit purchase occurred 60 days or more, prior to the refund request.</p>

<p>8. INDEMNIFICATION.</p>
